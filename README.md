WARNING!

**Io-Gui is currently being refactored and some portions will be rewritten from scratch. Please be advised that the library is not production ready and documentatio might be outdated.**

Io-Gui is a UI framework for web development written in TypeScript. It relies on modern web platform features to bring simplicity and performance to web development.

Io-Gui can be used in various development environments and it plays well with common tools, libraries and frameworks.

Io-Gui lets you write fast and reactive custom elements that respond to state changes, data binding events and object mutations. It has comprehensive documentation, wide test coverage and a collection of examples and demos.

Io-Gui includes a robust UI design system with menus, layout panels, object editors, color pickers, sliders and more. It can also support entire application architecture with routing, tree shaking and code splitting. This website is made entirely with Io-Gui.

For quick start, read about the [basic usage](https://iogui.dev/io/#path=docs:./docs/getting-started.md#usage), check out the included [collection of elements](https://iogui.dev/io/#path=demos:elements) and the <a href="https://github.com/io-gui/io/" target="_blank">source code</a>.

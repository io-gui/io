Io-Gui is a reactive web UI framework that provides a consistent reactive foundation that supports multiple architectural patterns. It takes a multi-paradigm approach because different UI problems require different architectural solutions. Io-Gui adapts its architecture to the problem domain while maintaining consistent reactive principles throughout.

Io-Gui relies on interoperable reactive **nodes** and **elements** that respond to state changes and mutations. They provide a base for a reactive architecture that combines the best aspects of declarative component-based design, with reactive and composable development patterns.

To learn about Io-Gui, read the [quick start] and the [deep dive] guide.

Stay in touch on [github] and [bluesky].

## Development

Io-Gui has no runtime dependencies and only a few development dependencies. Aside from the typescript compiler, Io-Gui relies on minimal tooling for development, linting and testing. You should be able to just type `tsc` and get started. However, for the sake of convenience, it uses [pnpm] to run a few development scripts. Using IoGui (esnext) in your project requires no compilation or build tools.

To download and develop Io-Gui locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/io-gui/io.git && cd io
pnpm i && pnpm dev:gui
```

This will install dev dependencies and start the typescript watch script. You will also need to run `pnpm serve` to run @web/dev-server. Or you can run any other web server of your choice.

You are helping development of a custom UI framework called "Io-Gui".

Data is rendered/assigned from trunk to leafs using change handlers:
- Generic property handler `.changed()`
- Specific property change handler `.[prop]Changed()`

Bi-directional data flow can be achieved if needed by using:
- Binding function `.bind([prop])`
- Listening to a change event `.addEventListener("[prop]-changed", handler)`

Object mutations flow leaf(s) to trunk.
Mutations are debounced and agregated at each node using `[prop]Mutated()` handler.
